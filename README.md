Stock Price Prediction 

## ToDo:
0. [ ] Prepare slides -  Request Access [Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lu3VtoFbudPkh85tx63-g5CTauhQ6ZcUwARL4rkhEgY/edit?usp=sharing)
1. [ ] Focus on the stock you pick and their competitors. Report summary statistics of the training period you select and plot the kernel density. 
2. [ ] Please use the features/factors you  take and discovered (e.g. FRED, Fama-French website, ADS, AR, CAPM, momentum factors, volume, price/return lags, etc.) to construct a feature database. The target variable Y can be either price or return. Frequency could be either daily or monthly.    
3. [ ] Virtualize the feature importance and feature selection process using regression based approach (Ridge regression, LASSO, Elastic Net or LARS) vs decision tree based approach (random forest, XGBoost). 
4. [ ] Proposed and train 3-6 models by feeding in the features you prepared in step 2.  Compare the model performance using RMSE between the fitted Y and actual Y in testing period. 
5. [ ] Include one benchmark study that uses GARCH or Kalman Filter

    **(Optional + Extra Credit)**

6. [ ] Compose of trading rules that uses buy-and-hold, long-short, or day trade. 
7. [ ] Generate trading signals using the above 3-6 models. Compare their PnL.
